# Description

A drawing of Rachel I made last month (I'm writing this in March).

I originally made Rachel in 2020 when I was in the middle of a *South Park* fixation. To quote a wiki article I made on her: "Rachel is a cannibal (USED TO) due to being Nightmare's sister." (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240305032928/https://officialsouthparkocmania.fandom.com/wiki/Rachel">source</a>)

She was supposed to have two forms (pictured below): a human form and a true form. This was because of her being related to another South Park <abbr title="Original Character" alt="Original Character">OC</abbr> (Original Character) (that I didn't even own): <a href="https://southparkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Nightmare_(Character)">Nightmare, overlord of Planet Diabolis</a>.

<img src="/oldrocket/assets/images/postspecific/Rachel.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Rachel's human form, 2020, colorized" title="Rachel's human form, 2020, colorized"> <img src="/oldrocket/assets/images/postspecific/RachelTrue.png" width="200" height="200" alt="Rachel's true form, 2020, colorized" title="Rachel's true form, 2020, colorized">

Of course, after feeling that I was going too far into copying this OC, I decided to scrap the "omg she has two forms" part of the character, and now she's just a regular woman. Tada.
